    "\n",
    "## Definition\n",
    "Some quantities in the world are completely described using a single number (with a unit, of course). These are called __scalar__ quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Vector__ quantities, in contrast, are those which __have an associated direction,__ and thus cannot be described using a single number.\n",
    "\n",
    "A _vector_ is a quantity which has both __magnitude__ (size) and __direction.__\n",
    "\n",
    "## Examples\n",

    "## Symbology\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are represented mathematically as variables using symbols with small arrows above them. No matter which direction the vector itself points, _the symbol always has an arrow pointing to the right._\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Symbol for a vector quantity:} \\space \\Large\\vec{v}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The __magnitude__ of a vector can be depicted symbolically in a couple of ways: by a vector symbol within an absolute value sign, or double absolute value sign, or&mdash;more frequently&mdash;by the letter without the little arrow on top.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{e.g.}\\quad v \\space = \\space |\\vec{v}| \\space = ||\\vec{v}|| \\space = \\space 5 \\space \\small{\\text{m/s}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geometric Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "The geometric representation of a vector is an arrow, with the tail of the arrow placed _at the point where it the measurement is made._ Vectors are always drawn with an arrowhead at the tip.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='./vector_example.png' title='An example vector' alt='An example vector'/>\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style='font-weight: bold; color: orange;'>Note:</span> Although the vector arrow is drawn across the page, from its tail to its tip, this does not indicate that the vector \"stretches\" across this distance. Instead, __the vector arrow tells us the value of the vector quantity only at the one point where the tail of the vector is placed.__\n",
    "\n",
    "___\n",
    "\n",
    "## Rough Document Outline\n",
    "* Vector magnitude can be positive or zero, but __never negative.__\n",
    "\n",
    "* __Symbols:__ vectors are represented symbolically as _variables with arrows above them_&mdash;e.g. $\\vec{v}$ or $\\vec{A}$. Variables without arrows&mdash;e.g.$r$ and $A$&mdash;are symbols for scalar values. __This distinction is very important, because frequently both variables&mdash;e.g. $r$ and $\\vec{r}$&mdash;will be used in the same problem, to represent _different quantities.___\n",

    "# Acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "Acceleration, though it seems to be a simple concept, can be quite confusing when represented in motion diagrams and other representations as vector quantities.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Acceleration Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speeding Up\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object is speeding up, the _acceleration vector_ points in the __same direction__ as the _velocity vector._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Slowing Down\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object is slowing down, the _acceleration vector_ points in the __opposite direction__ as the _velocity vector._\n",
    "\n",
    "### Acceleration &amp; Position\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a position graph __curves upward,__ acceleration is _increasing._\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a position graph __curves downward,__ acceleration is _decreasing._\n",
    "\n",
    "## One-Dimensional Acceleration\n",
    "\n",
    "When analyzing or describing __one-dimensional__ motion, position, velocity, and acceleration are traditionally represented as scalar values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sign of acceleration ($a_x$ or $a_y$) tells you _which way the acceleration vector points,_ not whether the object is speeding up or slowing down."
